After 2 hours of attempting to solve this problem for my current, I got working solution.
Lets say there is list (<ul>) and it has rows (<li>), and we need to change/update last row of it.
This functionality is need for showing downloading percentage for terminal window UI element.

I have updateLastLineOnTerminal function;
lstLogMessages - my Log Messages List


function updateLastLineOnTerminal(message)
{
	let newLine ='<span style="color: blue;">'+message+'</span>';
    let content = document.getElementById('lstLogMessages');
    content.lastElementChild.innerHTML = newLine;
}
